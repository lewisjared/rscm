Components can now return spatially-resolved grid outputs (FourBox and Hemispheric) natively, enabling regional values to flow between components without aggregation to scalars.
The `OutputState` type now supports `StateValue` variants for grids, and the ComponentIO macro automatically wraps grid outputs in the appropriate variant.
