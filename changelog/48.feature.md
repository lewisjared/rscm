Added grid-based timeseries infrastructure for spatially-resolved climate modeling.

This release introduces support for regional climate data through a flexible grid system:

- **Grid Types**: Implemented `ScalarGrid` (single global value), `FourBoxGrid` (MAGICC standard with Northern/Southern Ocean/Land regions), and `HemisphericGrid` (Northern/Southern hemispheres)
- **GridTimeseries**: Generic timeseries type `GridTimeseries<T, G>` with compile-time grid knowledge, supporting interpolation, aggregation, and transformations between grid types
- **Type-Safe Access**: Region enums (`FourBoxRegion`, `HemisphericRegion`, `ScalarRegion`) provide compile-time safety for regional data access
- **State System Integration**: Added `StateValue` enum and grid-aware methods (`get_latest_value()`, `get_global()`, `get_region()`) to `InputState` for seamless scalar/grid handling
- **Python Bindings**: Exposed all grid types to Python with PyO3 wrappers, including region constants and grid operations
- **Example Component**: Included `FourBoxOceanHeatUptakeComponent` demonstrating scalar-to-grid disaggregation patterns

The implementation maintains full backwards compatibility with existing scalar timeseries code. Components can continue using scalar values while new components can leverage regional resolution where appropriate. Grid transformations are explicit and type-checked to prevent silent data loss.
