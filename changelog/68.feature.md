Added schema-driven grid auto-aggregation. Components can now read variables at coarser resolutions than the schema declares (e.g., reading a Scalar when the schema stores FourBox data), and write at finer resolutions. The model automatically aggregates using configurable area weights via `ModelBuilder.with_grid_weights()`.
