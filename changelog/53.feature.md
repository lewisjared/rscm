Added `ComponentIO` derive macro for type-safe component development with struct-level `#[inputs(...)]`, `#[outputs(...)]`, and `#[states(...)]` attributes.

The macro generates typed input/output structs with compile-time field validation, eliminating stringly-typed component APIs. Components can now access inputs through `TimeseriesWindow` for zero-cost timeseries access and return typed output structs.
