Added model calibration and uncertainty quantification framework (`rscm.calibrate`). Supports MCMC sampling via affine-invariant ensemble sampler (Goodman & Weare 2010), point estimation, convergence diagnostics (R-hat, ESS), and chain persistence. Includes Python bindings with tqdm progress bars and pandas DataFrame integration.
