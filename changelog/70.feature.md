Added Python regression test framework for validating MAGICC component implementations against Fortran MAGICC7 reference outputs. Tests cover concentration-driven runs, emissions-driven runs, climate sensitivity sweeps, and CO2-only forcing mode. All 9 tests are skipped pending MAGICC component implementation.
