# # Coupled models
#
# When modelling a complex systemm
# often you need more than one component coupled together.
# Each component will model a particular aspect of the Earth System
# using a set of equations with some known inputs and outputs.
# These inputs can come from other components or prescribed as
# exogenous variables if not components produce that variable as output.
#
# Typically, a model consists of more than one component.
# These components will interact with each other by passing state amongst them.

# ## Building the model
#
# The `ModelBuilder` class can be used to build up a coupled model.
# This builder class captures the requirements for the model including components,
# time axis and exogenous variables before creating a concrete model.
# This makes it easier to share model setups and extend them if needed.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Time axis
#
# The time axis is a critical aspect of a model as it defines the timesteps
# on which the model is solved.
# Components only exchange information at the end of a time step.
#
# The size of the timesteps don't need to be the same across the time axis.
# This enables the use of longer timesteps during preindustrial spinup
# and then decreasing as the level of anthropogenic emissions increases.

# ### Components
#
# A model consists of one or more components.
#
# Below we create a model that consists of a basic carbon cycle
# and a CO2 ERF calculation.
# The CO2 ERF component calculates the radiative forcing of CO2
# modified CO2 concentrations from the Carbon Cycle component.

# We don't have a cononical way of dealing with parameters yet.
# Ideally they should be decoupled from describing how the components interact

# ## Initial Values
#
# The Carbon Cycle component is a coupled set of ordinary differential equations
# that are solved as an initial value problem.
# In order to solve these equations the state ot t=0 must be known.
# For later time steps the state from the previous time step is used
#
# This step might be refactored to be included in the component builder.

# ## Build the model
#
# We can now build the model.
# This step generates a directed graph of the relationships between the components.
# This graph is then used by the model to determine the order in which
# it should solve the components.
# If any required information is missing then this step will fail
# with an exceptions which explains what it required.
#
# Often additional exogenous data is required.
